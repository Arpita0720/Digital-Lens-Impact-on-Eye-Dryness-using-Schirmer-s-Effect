## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

With the increasing use of digital screens, eye dryness has become a common issue. This project leverages Schirmer's test data and machine learning to analyze the impact of digital lens usage on eye dryness. By understanding these effects, we aim to enhance eye care awareness and suggest preventive measures.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes responses collected from individuals based on:
- **Demographics** (age, gender, etc.)
- **Screen time usage** (work vs. non-work screen exposure)
- **Schirmer’s test results** (eye dryness levels)
- **User habits** (screen brightness, distance, frequency of blinking)

## 🔥 Key Highlights

✅ **Machine Learning-Based Prediction** – Uses trained ML models to predict eye dryness severity.  
✅ **Real-World Impact** – Helps users understand their risk of digital eye strain.  
✅ **Data-Driven Insights** – Provides meaningful analysis based on Schirmer’s test data.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – An intuitive front-end form to collect user input.  
✅ **Enhanced Eye Care Awareness** – Educates users on better digital screen habits.
