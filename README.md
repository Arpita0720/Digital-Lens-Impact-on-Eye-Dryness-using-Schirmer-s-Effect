# Digital Lens Impact on Eye Dryness using Schirmer's Effect 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of digital lens usage on eye dryness using Schirmer's test data and machine learning. With increasing screen time, it's crucial to understand how digital exposure affects eye health.

## ❓ Why Does This Project Matter?
- With excessive digital screen usage, many individuals experience eye dryness and discomfort.
- Understanding the relationship between digital lens usage and eye dryness can help in preventive measures and better eye care solutions.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- Schirmer's test results measuring tear production.
- Digital screen usage data including hours spent on different devices.
- Personal attributes like age, gender, and eye-related symptoms.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Gather data from users via a web form.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Select relevant features influencing eye dryness.
4. **Model Training** – Use machine learning models to predict dryness levels.
5. **Results Visualization** – Generate insights using visual analytics.

## 📈 Results
- The project identified key factors contributing to eye dryness.
- High screen time and improper viewing habits were significant contributors.
- The ML model provided accurate predictions of dryness severity.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy by integrating more diverse data.
- Implement real-time monitoring of screen exposure.
- Develop a mobile app for user-friendly tracking and recommendations.
